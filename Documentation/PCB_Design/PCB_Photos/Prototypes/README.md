**This folder contains photos of the prototype electronic design of the PCBs produced for the stepper/DC motor and the weight sensor.**

Details about the images:

- Motor_Driver_Prototype_Top and Motor_Driver_Prototype_Bottom are photos of the top and bottom side of the prototype manufactured PCB for the stepper and the DC motor (top and bottom sides respectively).
