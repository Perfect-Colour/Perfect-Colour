**This folder contains the documentation of the full electronic design.**

It is split into two main folders - PCB_Design and Schematics. These are further split into sub-folders which split the project into its two main stages - prototype and final. Initially, two prototype electronic designs were created for testing the motors (stepper and DC) and the load cell. Later on, it was decided that these should be merged in one design which was a Raspberry Pi shield PCB. This was the final design and its integration with the Raspberry Pi can be seen in the figure below:
