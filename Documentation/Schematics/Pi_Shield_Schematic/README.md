**This folder contains the files used for the prototype electronic design for the stepper motor.**

All components featured are surface mount apart from the terminal connectors through which the stepper and DC motors and the load cell are connected to the board. The following components are used for this electronic design:

- Chips: HX711 and two L298.

- Resistors: two 10kOhm, one 1kOhm and one 8.2kOhm.

- Transisotrs: two surface mount PNP.

- Capacitors: three ceramic 1microFarad, five ceramic 100nanoFarad and four electrolytic 1microFarad.

- Diodes: twelve 1N5814 surface mount diodes.

- Connections: one 4-pin and two 2-pin terminal connectors.
