**This folder contains the files used for the prototype electronic design for the stepper motor.**

It features the following:

- Chip: L298 motor driver.

- Capacitors: two ceramic 100nanoFarad and two electrolytic 1microFarad.

- Connections: one 4-pin and five 2-pin MOLEX connectors.

- Diodes: eight through hole diodes (for the two H-bridge rectifiers).
