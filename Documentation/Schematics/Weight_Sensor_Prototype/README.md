The files in this folder contain the prototype electronic design created for the weight sensor used for the project.

It implements the following:
- Chip: HX711.

- Resistors: two 10kOhm, one 1kOhm and one 8.2kOhm.

- PNP transistor.

- Capacitors: three 1microFarad and one 100nanoFarad.

- Connections: two 4-pin MOLEX connectors.
