 ##  1. Design Description
 The Perfect Colour Machine consists of a caroussel that holds 5 syringes containing the CMYK(Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Key) plus white colours.The caroussel is held up by a table-like structure and the paint is disposed onto a palette (or plate) which is on top of a weight sensor.
 
 ## 2. Parts
 The main parts of the structure are summarised below:

 ## 3. Manufacturing
 
 The parts were manufactured individually using different materials. However, aluminium was used for the most important parts to make it more durable. Other materials might not be able to withstand the torques produced by the spin of the caroussel. Therefore, the caroussel was manufactured in aluminium and aluminium rods were used for all connections.
