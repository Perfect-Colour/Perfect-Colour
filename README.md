Through the use of the GUI, you can select the colour using two different methods: by using the colour wheel or by selecting the colour you wish on an image which can then be made for you.

## FAQs

**- Is there a phone appliacation available?**

There is no applications available for phones or tablets at the moment. However, we do consider this for a future development.

**- Can other types of paints be used?**

The machine is designed to produce colours from five colours of acrylic paints. The accuracy might vary with the quality and types of paint used. However, this can be addressed through calibration. Other paints like oil could obtain similar colours, however, due to the design of the machine, the results would not be the same.

**- Can I choose the exact colour I want?**

Indeed. You can either choose it within a palette or even take a picture and select the exact a colour from the desired pixel.

**- Can any colour be produced?**

Yes! CMYK plus white, when mixed correctly, can produce any colour. However, bear in mind this is dependant on the paints you are using, as if you use very matte primary colours, you will not be able to produce a bright gold, so choose your primary CMYK carefully.

**- Does the machine produce the colour I see or the real colour?**

The machine will produce the colour you see, so it will depend on the lighting conditions you took the picture in. Bare in mind that if what you want is the real colour instead, you would have to balance the whites of the picture before uploading it.
