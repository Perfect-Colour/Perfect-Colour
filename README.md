Through the use of the GUI, you can select the colour using two different methods: by using the colour wheel or by selecting the colour you wish on an image which can then be made for you.

## 4. FAQs

**- Is there a phone appliacation available?

There is no applications available for phones or tablets at the moment. However, we do consider this for a future development.

**- Can other types of paints be used?**

The machine is designed to produce colours with acrylic. The accuracy might vary with the quality and types of paint used. Other paints like oil could obtain similar colours, however, due to the design of the machine, the results would not be the same.

**- Can I choose the exact colour I want?**

Indeed. You can either choose it within a palette or even take a picture and select the exact pixel (colour) you want in it.

**- Can any colour be produced?**

Yes! CMYK plus white, when mixed correctly, should be able to produce any colour.
